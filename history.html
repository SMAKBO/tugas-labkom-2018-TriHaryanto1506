  <h1 class="he1">History About Acetic Acid</h1>
  <center><img src="img/history.jpg"></center>
  <h2 class="he2">Who Acetic Acid Discovered ?</h2>
  <p>Vinegar comes from French, vin aigre, which means sour wine. Vinegar also has another name,
namely acetic acid or vinegar, a chemical compound of organic acids known as giver acid or aroma in
cooking. This fermented food has been used as cooking spice since 3000 BC in Mesopotamia. At that
time, about 40% of the total wheat harvest was used for the manufacture of vinegar.</p>
  <p>In Egypt, the vinegar acid is produced from the fermentation of the immersed water of wheat
using microorganisms. The smell and taste of typical Egyptian vinegar is favored by the Greeks and
Romans. Both nations were finally made from different materials, among others from palm sap, wheat
seeds, and dates. The process of making vinegar in Egypt is then used as the basic process of making
vinegar until now.</p>
<p>Vinegar has been known to mankind since ancient times. Vinegar is produced by various acetic
acid-producing bacteria, and acetic acid is a by-product of brewing or wine.</p>
<h2 class="he2">When Acetic Acid Was First Used?</h2>
<p>The use of acetic acid as a chemical reagent has also started long ago. In the 3rd century BC, the
ancient Greek philosopher Theophrastos explained that vinegar reacts with metals to form dyes, such as
white lead (lead carbonate), and verdigris, a mixed green substance of copper salts and containing copper
( II) acetate.</p>
<p>In the 8th century, the Persian scientist Jabir ibn Hayyan produced concentrated acetic acid from
vinegar by distillation. At the time of renaissance, glacial acetic acid was produced from dry distillation of
acetate metal. In the 16th century German alchemist Andreas Libavius explained the procedure, and
compared the glacial acetic acid produced to vinegar. Apparently glacial acetic acid has many different
properties with acetic acid solution in water, so many chemists believe that both are actually two different
substances. French chemist Pierre Adet has finally proven that these two substances are the same.</p>
<p>In 1847 the German chemist Hermann Kolbe synthesized acetic acid from inorganic substances
for the first time. The chemical reactions carried out are chlorination of carbon disulfide into carbon
tetrachloride, followed by pyrolysis to tetrachloroethylene and chlorination in water to trichloroacetic
acid, and finally reduction by electrolysis to acetic acid.</p>
<p>Since 1910 most acetic acid is produced from pyrolygeous liquids obtained from wood
distillation. This liquid is reacted with calcium hydroxide to produce calcium acetate which is then
acidified with sulfuric acid to produce acetic acid. At the time, Germany produced 10,000 tons of glacial
acetic acid, about 30% of which was used for the production of indigo dyes.</p>
<p>Because both methanol and carbon monoxide are common commodity raw materials, methanol
carbonylation is a special attraction as a precursor of acetic acid. Henri Dreyfus in British Celanese
developed the forerunner of the methanol carbonylation plant in early 1925. [24] However, the lack of
necessary practical materials can accommodate a corrosive reaction mixture at high pressure (200 atm or
more) break the commercialization of this process. The first commercial methanol carbonylation process,
using cobalt as a catalyst, was developed by the German chemical company BASF in 1963. In 1968,
rhodium-based (cis- [Rh (CO) 2I2] -) catalyst was found to operate efficiently at low pressure with almost
without a by-product. US chemical company Monsanto Company built its first plant using this catalyst in
1970, and the methanol carbonylation with rhodium catalyst became the dominant method of acetic acid
production (see Monsanto process). In the late 1990s, chemical company BP Chemicals commercialized
Cativa ([Ir (CO) 2I2] -) catalysts, with iridium precursors for greater efficiency. Cativa's catalyzed iridium
process is more environmentally friendly and more efficient and has replaced the Monsanto process.</p>
