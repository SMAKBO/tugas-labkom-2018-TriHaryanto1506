  <h2 class="he2">What is Physical Properties ?</h2>
      <p> A physical property is any property that is measurable, whose value describes a state of a physical system.[1] The changes in the physical properties of a system can be used to describe its changes between momentary states. Physical properties are often referred to as observables. They are not modal properties. Quantifiable physical property is called physical quantity.

Physical properties are often characterized as intensive and extensive properties. An intensive property does not depend on the size or extent of the system, nor on the amount of matter in the object, while an extensive property shows an additive relationship. These classifications are in general only valid in cases when smaller subdivisions of the sample do not interact in some physical or chemical process when combined.

Properties may also be classified with respect to the directionality of their nature. For example, isotropic properties do not change with the direction of observation, and anisotropic properties do have spatial variance.

It may be difficult to determine whether a given property is a material property or not. Color, for example, can be seen and measured; however, what one perceives as color is really an interpretation of the reflective properties of a surface and the light used to illuminate it. In this sense, many ostensibly physical properties are called supervenient. A supervenient property is one which is actual, but is secondary to some underlying reality. This is similar to the way in which objects are supervenient on atomic structure. A cup might have the physical properties of mass, shape, color, temperature, etc., but these properties are supervenient on the underlying atomic structure, which may in turn be supervenient on an underlying quantum structure.

Physical properties are contrasted with chemical properties which determine the way a material behaves in a chemical reaction.</p>
  
  <h2 class="he2">Physical Properties of Acetic Acid</h2>
        <p>     Acetic acid is a colourless liquid; with a strong vinegar-like odour. It is flammable, and at temperatures warmer than 39°C, explosive vapour/air mixtures may be formed. Acetic acid is considered a volatile organic compound by the National Pollutant Inventory.

Specific Gravity: 1.049 @ 25°C

Melting Point: 16.7°C

Boiling Point: 118°C

Vapour pressure: 1.5 kPa @ 20°C</p>
    
  <h2 class="he2">What is Chemical Properties ?</h2>
  <p>     A chemical property is any of a material's properties that becomes evident during, or after, a chemical reaction; that is, any quality that can be established only by changing a substance's chemical identity.[1] Simply speaking, chemical properties cannot be determined just by viewing or touching the substance; the substance's internal structure must be affected greatly for its chemical properties to be investigated. When a substance goes under a chemical reaction, the properties will change drastically, resulting in chemical change. However, a catalytic property would also be a chemical property.

Chemical properties can be contrasted with physical properties, which can be discerned without changing the substance's structure. However, for many properties within the scope of physical chemistry, and other disciplines at the boundary between chemistry and physics, the distinction may be a matter of researcher's perspective. Material properties, both physical and chemical, can be viewed as supervenient; i.e., secondary to the underlying reality. Several layers of superveniency[clarification needed] are possible.

Chemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications. They can also be useful to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances. Materials science will normally consider the chemical properties of a substance to guide its applications.</p>
  
    <h2 class="he2">Chemical Properties of Acetic Acid</h2>
    <p>     Chemical Properties:Clear colorless liquidGeneral Description:A colorless aqueous solution. Smells like vinegar. Density 8.8 lb / gal.Corrosive to metals and tissue.Air & Water Reactions:Dilution with water releases some heat.Reactivity Profile:ACETIC ACID, reacts exothermically with chemical bases. Subject tooxidation (with heating) by strong oxidizing agents. Dissolution in water moderates the chemicalreactivity of acetic acid, A 5% solution of acetic acid is ordinary vinegar. Acetic acid formsexplosive mixtures with p-xylene and air.Health Hazard:Toxic; inhalation, ingestion or skin contact with material may cause severe injuryor death. Contact with molten substance may cause severe burns to skin and eyes. Avoid any skincontact. Effects of contact or inhalation may be delayed. Fire may produce irritating, corrosiveand/or toxic gases. Runoff from fire control or dilution water may be corrosive and/or toxic andcause pollution.Fire Hazard:Combustible material: may burn but does not ignite readily. When heated, vapors mayform explosive mixtures with air: indoors, outdoors and sewers explosion hazards. Contact withmetals may evolve flammable hydrogen gas. Containers may explode when heated. Runoff may pollute waterways. Substance may be transported in a molten form</p>
