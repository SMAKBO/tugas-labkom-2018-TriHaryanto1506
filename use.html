  <h1 class="he1">Use of Acetic Acid</h1>
  <center><img src="img/use.jpg"></center>
  <h2 class="he2">What Usability of Acetic Acid ?</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Acetic acids has many benefits in various fields, such as uses in industry, in chemistry, in medicine, in the field of food, and in daily life. Below are some of the use of acetic acid: </p>
    
  <h2 class="he2">Acetic Acid Uses in Industry</h2>
    <center><img src="img/Soft Drink Bottles.jpg"width="240px"></center>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Acetic acid is usually used as a solvent in industrial production processes. For example the use of acetic acid in the manufacture of soft drink bottles, rubber and plastic manufacture. Acetic acid is also used in the process of making pesticides. Acetic acid is used as a raw material for cellulose acetate, commonly used in the film industry. In addition, as a raw material to manufacture polyvinyl acetate, which is the raw material for making wood glue.</p>

  <h2 class="he2">Acetic Acid Uses in Chemistry</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Acetic acid is used as a chemical reagent to produce various chemical compounds. Most (40-45%) of the world's acetic acid is used as a material to produce Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) monomers. In addition acetic acid is also used in the production of acetic anhydride and also esters. The use of other acetic acid, including its use in vinegar is relatively small.</p>

  <h3 class="he2">1. Vinyl Acetate Monomer</h3>
    <center><img src="img/Vinyl Acetat Monomer.jpg"width="180px"style="float:right"></center>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The primary use of acetic acid is the production of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). In 2008, this application was estimated to consume a third of the world's production of acetic acid. The reaction consists of ethylene and acetic acid with oxygen over a palladium catalyst, conducted in the gas phase.</p>
    <center>
      <p>2 H<sub>3</sub>C-COOH + 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 H<sub>3</sub>C–CO–O–CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    </center>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Vinyl acetate can be polymerised to polyvinyl acetate or other polymers, which are components in paints and adhesives.</p>

  <h3 class="he2">2. Ester Production</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The major esters of acetic acid are commonly used as solvents for inks, paints and coatings. The esters include ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, and propyl acetate. They are typically produced by catalyzed reaction from acetic acid and the corresponding alcohol:</p>
    <center>
      <p>H<sub>3</sub>C-COOH + HO-R → H<sub>3</sub>C-CO-O-R + H<sub>2</sub>O, (R= a general alkyl group)</p>
    </center>
      <p style="text-align:justify">This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, have been shown to be harmful to human reproduction.</p>

  <h3 class="he2">3. Acetic Anhydride</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The product of the condensation of two molecules of acetic acid is acetic anhydride. The worldwide production of acetic anhydride is a major application, and uses approximately 25% to 30% of the global production of acetic acid. The main process involves dehydration of acetic acid to give ketene at 700–750 °C. Ketene is thereafter reacted with acetic acid to obtain the anhydride:</p>
    <center>
      <p>CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H → CH<sub>2</sub>=C=O + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
      <p>CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H + CH<sub>2</sub>=C=O → (CH<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    </center>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Acetic anhydride is an acetylation agent. As such, its major application is for cellulose acetate, a synthetic textile also used for photographic film. Acetic anhydride is also a reagent for the production of heroin and other compounds.</p>

  <h3 class="he2">4. Uses as Solvent Chemical</h3>
    <center><img src="img/Acetic Acid Glasial.jpg" width="135px"style="float:right"></center>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Glacial acetic acid is a good polar protic solvent, as mentioned above. It is often used as a solvent in recrystallization to purify organic compounds. Glacial acetic acid is used in analytical chemistry to determine a weak base content such as an organic amide. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It can then be titrated using a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid, dissolved in glacial acetic acid.</p>
  
  <h2 class="he2">Acetic Acid Uses in Medicine</h2>
    <center><img src="img/Iontoforesis.jpg"></center>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Dilute acetic acid is used in physical therapy using iontoforesis. Vinegar (acetic acid) typically contains 4-18% mass of acetic acid. Vinegar is used directly as a spice, and in preserving vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar tends to be more dilute (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial pickled foods use a more concentrated solution. The amount of acetic acid used as vinegar on a world scale is not large, but it is the oldest and most famous application.</p>

  <h2 class="he2">Acetic Acid in the Field of Food</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify">In the food industry, acetic acid has been approved as an additive in foods with registration number E260. In Indonesia, acetic acid is often used as an ingredient to preserve food, such as in the manufacture of candied fruits or vegetables.</p>
  
  <h2 class="he2">Acetic Acid Uses in Daily Life</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify">1) Soften the hair, this may sound strange, but using apple cider vinegar as rinse after shampooing can really make hair shiny and softer. Not only that, vinegar will also get rid of the remnants of shampoo and and close the cuticle. Just add half a tablespoon of vinegar to a cup of water plus a few drops of essential oil if you like. Pour in the tub and then use as a rinse. Indeed, the hair may smell like a food preparation for a while, but soon the smell will disappear.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">2) Remove the underarm stain on the shirt, Stains due to sweat, in addition can really damage the clothes, also difficult to remove with ordinary cleaners. Spray white vinegar on the stain before washing and the stain will disappear.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">3) Extend the life of flowers, Living flowers to decorate the room is not going to last long. They will often wither after only a few days. Keep the freshness of the flowers longer by adding two tablespoons of white vinegar in the vase.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">4) Cleaning the paint brush, Forget cleaning the brush so it becomes stiff and hard? Do not jump right away. Fill the pan with pure white vinegar and bring to a boil over medium heat. Dip the brush into it until the paint is melted.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">5) Disping ants. This insidious insect turned out to not like vinegar. So, spray a mixture of white vinegar and water where they gather. Vinegar also removes traces of aroma ants use to show their food sources to their friends.</p>
