  <h2 class="he2">Asetic Acid Uses in Industry</h2>
      <p>Acetic acid is usually used as a solvent in industrial production processes. For example the use of acetic acid in the manufacture of soft drink bottles, rubber and plastic manufacture. Acetic acid is also used in the process of making pesticides. Acetic acid is used as a raw material for cellulose acetate, commonly used in the film industry. In addition, as a raw material to manufacture polyvinyl acetate, which is the raw material for making wood glue.</p>

  <h2 class="he2">Asetic Acid Uses in Chemistry</h2>
      <p>Acetic acid is used as a chemical reagent to produce various chemical compounds. Most (40-45%) of the world's acetic acid is used as a material to produce Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) monomers. In addition acetic acid is also used in the production of acetic anhydride and also esters. The use of other acetic acid, including its use in vinegar is relatively small.</p>

  <h3 class="he2">1. Vinyl Acetate Monomer</h3>
      <p>The primary use of acetic acid is the production of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). In 2008, this application was estimated to consume a third of the world's production of acetic acid. The reaction consists of ethylene and acetic acid with oxygen over a palladium catalyst, conducted in the gas phase.</p>

      <p>2H<sub>3</sub>COOH+2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>=O<sub>2</sub>-->2H<sub>3</sub>C-CO-O-CH=CH<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    </center>
      <p>Vinyl acetate can be polymerised to polyvinyl acetate or other polymers, which are components in paints and adhesives.</p>

  <h3 class="he2">2. Ester Production</h3>
      <p>The major esters of acetic acid are commonly used as solvents for inks, paints and coatings. The esters include ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, and propyl acetate. They are typically produced by catalyzed reaction from acetic acid and the corresponding alcohol:</p>
    <center>
      <p>H<sub>3</sub>C-COOH+HO-R-->H<sub>3</sub>C-CO-O-R+H<sub>2</sub>O, (R= a general alkyl group)</p>
    </center>
      <p>This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, have been shown to be harmful to human reproduction.</p>
  

  <h3 class="he2">3. Asetic Anhydride</h3>
      <p>The product of the condensation of two molecules of acetic acid is acetic anhydride. The worldwide production of acetic anhydride is a major application, and uses approximately 25% to 30% of the global production of acetic acid. The main process involves dehydration of acetic acid to give ketene at 700–750 °C. Ketene is thereafter reacted with acetic acid to obtain the anhydride:</p>
    <center>
      <p>CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H-->CH<sub>2</sub>=C=O+H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
      <p>CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H+CH<sub>2</sub>=C=O-->(CH<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    </center>
      <p>Acetic anhydride is an acetylation agent. As such, its major application is for cellulose acetate, a synthetic textile also used for photographic film. Acetic anhydride is also a reagent for the production of heroin and other compounds.</p>

  <h3 class="he2">4. Uses as Solvent Chemical</h3>
      <p>Glacial acetic acid is a good polar protic solvent, as mentioned above. It is often used as a solvent in recrystallization to purify organic compounds. Glacial acetic acid is used in analytical chemistry to determine a weak base content such as an organic amide. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It can then be titrated using a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid, dissolved in glacial acetic acid.</p>
