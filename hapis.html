 <h1>Chemical Properties ofAcetic acid</h1>
Acetic acid is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written asCH3CO2H or C2H4O2). It is a colourless liquid that when undiluted is also called glacial aceticacid.Acetic acid is the main component of vinegar (apart from water; vinegar is roughly 8% aceticacid by volume), and has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. Besides its production ashousehold vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinylacetate and cellulose acetate.Although it is classified as a weak acid, concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and attacks the skin.Acetic acid is one of the simplest carboxylic acids. It is an important chemical reagent andindustrial chemical, mainly used in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film and polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, as well as synthetic fibers and fabrics. In households, dilutedacetic acid is often used in descaling agents. In the food industry, acetic acid is used under thefood additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as a condiment. As a food additive it isapproved for usage in many countries, including Canada, the EU, USA and Australia and NewZealand.Acetic acid is a weak acid which is probably most famous for being the primary acid in vinegar. Infact, acetic acid has a wide range of uses beyond sprinkling on salads, and it is produced in largevolumes all over the world. People have been working with this acid in a number of contexts for centuries, with acetic acid being one of the substances explored by alchemists, the predecessors of modern chemistsThis organic acid can be prepared in varying concentrations. In pure form, it is known as glacialacetic acid because it crystallizes in cool temperatures. This form of the acid is extremelycorrosive and can be hazardous to work with, requiring special precautions for protection. Vinegar, by contrast, usually has an acetic acid concentration of around five percent.
