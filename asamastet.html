		<h1>What is Acetic Acid ?</h1>

	</header>
		<p>Acetic acid,systematically named ethanoic acid, is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, it is sometimes called glacial acetic acid.Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell.It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.Acetic acid is the second simplest carboxylic acid (after formic acid). It consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and synthetic fibres and fabrics. The global demand for acetic acid is about 6.5 million metric tons per year (Mt/a), of which approximately 1.5 Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from methanol.[6] Vinegar is mostly dilute acetic acid, often produced by fermentation and subsequent oxidation of ethanol.

		<h2>Nomenclature Of Acetic Acid</h2>
		<p>The trivial name acetic acid is the most commonly used and preferred IUPAC name. The systematic name ethanoic acid, a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature.[7] The name acetic acid derives from acetum, the Latin word for vinegar, and is related to the word acid itself.Glacial acetic acid is a name for water-free (anhydrous) acetic acid. Similar to the German name Eisessig (ice-vinegar), the name comes from the ice-like crystals that form slightly below room temperature at 16.6 °C (61.9 °F) (the presence of 0.1% water lowers its melting point by 0.2 °C).
		A common abbreviation for acetic acid is AcOH, where Ac stands for the acetyl group CH3−C(=O)−.Acetate (CH3COO−) is abbreviated AcO−. The Ac is not to be confused with the abbreviation for the chemical element actinium.To better reflect its structure, acetic acid is often written as CH3–C(O)OH, CH3−C(=O)OH, CH3COOH, and CH3CO2H. In the context of acid-base reactions, the abbreviation HAc is sometimes used. Acetate is the ion resulting from loss of H+from acetic acid. The name acetate can also refer to a salt containing this anion, or an ester of acetic acid.</p>
