	<h2 class="he2">What Is Acetic Acid</h2>
	<p>Acetic acid or vinegar is an organic acid chemical compound commonly known as acid flavoring in foods, smelling of sting, having an empirical formula C4H202 or often written in the formula CH3COOH. Acetic acid is one of the simplest carboxylic acids after formic acid is a chemical reagent the most important in the field of industry. </p>
	<h2 class="he2">Nomenclature of Acetic Acid</h2>
  	<p class="p1">Acetic acid is a weak acid because when in acetic acid water is simply iodized to H + and CH3COO- concentrated acetic acid (glacial acid) is a colorless hygroscopic fluid.
Acetate is the ion produced from the loss of h + from acetic acid. acetic names may also refer to anionic salts.
Acetic acid is the trivial name or trade name of this compound and is the name most recommended by IUPAC. This name is derived from the Latin word acetum, which means vinegar. the systematic name of this compound is ethanoic acid.
Glacial acetic acid is the name of the trivial that refers to the aqueous acetic acid (anhydrous). is so called because water-free acetic acid forms ice-like crystals at 16.6 degrees Celsius (61.9 degrees farenhait), at temperatures just below room temperature.
